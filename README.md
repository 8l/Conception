Conception
==========

Conception is an experimental research project, meant to become a modern IDE/Language package. It experiments with discarding old conventions that were based on computational limitations (e.g. breaking code into files on a file system), and tries to make the process of coding as efficient as possible. I'm a fan of ideas from Bret Victor's talks, Light Table, Code Bubbles, Subtext, and of course I have ideas of my own.

My main guiding principle is to eliminate unnecessary duplication.

It started off from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/shurcooL/status/173110768726839296).

Please steal any good ideas you see here. I'd rather have them benefit the world than die in obscurity.
